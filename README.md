# CS-0445-Data-Structures
This repository includes the projects I did exceptionally well on from my Data Structures class. Please refer to the pdf file titled AssignmentInfo.pdf in each folder to understand the full assignment details for that respective assignment. 

Assignment 2-In this project, I implemented a StringBuilder class using circular doubly linked lists. The main method is in the file titled Assig2.java, and the StringBuilder class is in StringBuilder.java

Assignment 3-In this project, I re-implemented the StrigBuilder class from Assignment 2 but with recursive methods.  

Assignment 4-In this project, I created a program to test 4 different sorting algorithms and compare their runtimes. Then, I did a comparative analysis of these algorithms to determine which ones were the most efficient under certain circumstances.
